Hi! I am Utkarsh Maken, a final year undergraduate student in Computer Science and Engineering Department from IIT Kanpur. I hail from Dhanbad, Jharkhand(no not from Wasseypur). I get intrigued by anything new and like everything I get my hands on. Iâ€™ll be starting my career as a Software Developer at MTX Group which I am very excited for. In my free time, I love to do street photowalks and visit new places. Ping me to talk on anything ranging from life, computer science, coding, puzzles, fitness, photography or stock markets(a recent addition to the list).
